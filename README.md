# mRNA-miRNAs-cancer-pathways
This repo contains some data and code associated to our paper **Novel miRNA-mRNA interactions conserved in essential cancer pathways** (http://rdcu.be/reoP), by Eduardo Andres-Leon, Ildefonso Cases, Sergio Alonso and Ana M Rojas. Scientific Reports, 7th April, 2017.
Currently it contains the full code and data for the survival analyses, raw data required to conduct pathway enrichment analyses and differentiall expression results to infer conserved miRNA-mRNA interactions.
This repo is to be updated when applicable.
