# mRNA-miRNAs-cancer-pathways
This repo contains some data and code associated to our paper "Novel miRNA-mRNA interactions conserved in essential cancer pathways. By Eduardo Andres-Leon, Ildefonso Cases, Sergio Alonso and Ana M Rojas. Scientific Reports, 7th April, 2017".
Currently it contains the full code and data for the survival analyses, and the raw data required to conduct pathway enrichment analyses.
This repo is to be updated when applicable.
